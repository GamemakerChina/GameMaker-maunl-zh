    "The Path Editor":"路径编辑器",
    "The basic idea is rather simple - you define a path by drawing it in the path editor, then you can place an action (or code) in the creation event of an object to tell the instance to follow that particular path. You can also set the speed to follow the path and a number of other actions relating to the position and orientation of the path within the room. When you first create a path resource the path editor window will open with the following options:":"其基本思想相当简单——通过在路径编辑器中绘制路径来定义路径，然后可以在对象的创建事件中放置操作(或代码) ，告诉实例遵循该特定路径。您还可以设置跟随路径的速度，以及与房间内路径的位置和方向相关的许多其他操作。第一次创建路径资源时，路径编辑器窗口将打开，其中包含以下选项:",
    "{}At some point while creating your games you may need one of your instances to follow a path through a level. Now, this can be done in code by simply creating an array of positions within the room and then having an instance move between them, but that can be a chore to set up and is difficult to change, test and adapt for different instances. For this reason {}GameMaker{} has path resources and a dedicated path editor.":"{}在创建游戏的某个时刻，您可能需要一个实例来遵循通过某个级别的路径。现在，这可以在代码中完成，只需在房间内创建一个位置数组，然后让一个实例在它们之间移动，但是这可能是一个繁琐的设置，并且很难更改、测试和适应不同的实例。因此{} GameMaker {}有路径资源和专用的路径编辑器。"
