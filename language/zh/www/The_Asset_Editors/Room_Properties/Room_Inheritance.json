    "An important feature of the room editor is {}inheritance{}. Inheritance means that you can create a \"parent\" room then from that create a \"child\" room which will inherit all the parent room\u0027s properties. This child room is essentially a {}clone {}of the parent, and everything in it {}is linked to the parent room{}. This means that if you change the view in the parent, or move a tile, or add instances, it will be reflected in the child room. Not only that, in the child room you can selectively switch off inheritance for specific layers, instances, assets or anything else that is required.":"房间编辑器的一个重要功能就是{}继承{}。继承意味着您可以创建一个\"父\"房间，然后从该房间创建一个\"子\"房间，它将继承父房间的所有属性。此子房间本质上是父房间的{}克隆{}，其中的所有内容都{}链接到父房间{}。这意味着，如果您在父房间中更改视图、移动瓷砖或添加实例，它将反映在子房间中。不仅如此，在子房间中，您可以有选择地关闭特定层、实例、资源或任何其他所需的继承。",

    "{}Note that, within a room, inheritance is multi-layered and you can check individual items, groups of items on a single layer, item properties, or whole rooms as inheriting, and you can also inherit from consecutive rooms (so room C inherits from room B, which in turn has inherited from Room A). If you create a base room with nothing in it except the view setup - for example - you can then create all further rooms as being its children and they will all inherit the view properties of the parent room. But you can go a step further and create another base room with the \"view\" room as its parent which holds the general {}GUI{} instance and the controllers required in every game room. Now you can create child rooms from this and they will inherit both the controllers and GUIs from the parent room as well as the view setup from the parent of that room!":"{}请注意，在房间内，继承是多层的，您可以选中单个项目、单个层上的项目组、项目属性或整个房间作为继承，也可以从连续的房间继承(因此房间C继承自房间B，而房间B又继承自房间A)。如果创建的基本房间中除视图设置外没有其他内容，则可以将所有其他房间创建为其子房间，并且这些房间都将继承父房间的视图属性。但您可以更进一步，创建另一个基本房间，将\"view\"房间作为其父房间，该房间包含通用的{}图形用户界面{}实例和每个游戏室所需的控制器。现在您可以从中创建子房间，它们将继承来自父房间的控制器和图形用户界面，以及来自该房间父房间的视图设置！",

    "{}This can be a bit difficult to visualise at first, so let\u0027s look at an example: say you have a room with a city and a castle in the middle.

You want to have it so that in the game the castle is destroyed, but everything else in the city looks and behaves the same. You would create the initial room with everything as normal, then you\u0027d create a child room which inherits the parent room layers. In the child room you\u0027d switch {}off {}inheritance for the tile layer (or even individual tiles) for the castle area and them move/add/delete tiles to create the destroyed castle look.
