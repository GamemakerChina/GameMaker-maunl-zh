This variable is then checked to see if it exceeds the maximum length of 15 characters and if it does, the keyboard_string is replaced by a 15 character copy of the {}name{} string. This effectively limits the player input to 15 characters.":"上面的代码将允许玩家通过键盘输入字符串，然后将其存储在变量 {} 名称 {} 中。然后检查此变量是否超过15个字符的最大长度，如果超过，则将keyboard_string替换为 {} name{} 字符串的15个字符副本。这有效地将玩家输入限制为15个字符。",

The first character in a string is always indexed as 1 and not 0 as you may expect, so to copy (for example) the first five characters of string you would have {}string_copy(str, 1, 5){}.
