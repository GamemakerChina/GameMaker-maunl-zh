    "{}GameMaker{}{} has a great number of ways in which you can move instances around within your game room, ranging from setting speed and direction vectors to simply \"placing\" an instance at a specific position, as well as using more sophisticated methods like path-finding. There are also a good number of different methods for detecting collisions between two instances, and which you choose will depend largely on the type of game you are making and the exact situation that you need to use the collision functions in. The following sections cover all of this and list all the functions related to movement, path-finding and collisions:{}":"{}GameMaker{}{}有多种方法可以在游戏室内移动实例，从设置速度和方向向量到将实例简单地\"放置\"在特定位置，以及使用更复杂的方法(如路径查找)。还有许多不同的方法用于检测两个实例之间的碰撞，您选择这些方法将在很大程度上取决于您正在进行的游戏类型和您需要在其中使用碰撞函数的确切情况。以下各节涵盖了所有这些函数，并列出了与移动、路径查找和冲突相关的所有函数：{}",
