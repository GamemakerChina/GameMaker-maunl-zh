This function is essential as a debug tool but it should be noted that it is {}very{} slow and only works when used in the {}draw{} event of the instance, and that you can set the draw alpha to change the opacity of the grid, permitting you to draw it as an overlay and see what is actually in the room at the same time.":"此函数将绘制指定的 MP 网格 (由 {}{}mp_grid_create(){}{} 定义)，将空闲单元格标记为绿色，将禁止单元格标记为红色。此函数作为调试工具是必不可少的，但应注意，它非常慢，并且仅在实例的 {} 绘制 {} 事件中使用时才有效，并且您可以设置绘制 Alpha 以更改网格的不透明度，从而允许您将其绘制为叠加，同时查看房间中的实际内容。"
