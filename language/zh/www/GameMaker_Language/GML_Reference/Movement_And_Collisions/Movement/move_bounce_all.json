    "The above code would be placed in a collision event with another object. It first checks to see if the object is visible and if it is it then performs the {}move_bounce_all(){} action. Note that in this case the bounce is selective and will only be calculated for this collision, rather than for every instance, every step.":"上述代码将被放置在与另一个对象的碰撞事件中。它首先检查对象是否可见，然后执行{}move_bounce_all(){}操作。请注意，在这种情况下，反弹是选择性的，并且将仅针对此碰撞而不是针对每个实例、每个步骤进行计算。",

    "With this function you can command an instance to bounce off {}all{} instances within the room, with the only exception being those that have no sprite or mask index assigned to them. You can also tell it to use precise collision checking when enabled, but be aware that this requires all instances to have precise masks enabled and will greatly slow down your game when many instances are involved due to the amount of processing that has to be done. This should normally go in the step event of an instance, but can be used selectively in a collision event too, as illustrated by the code example below.":"使用此函数，您可以命令实例关闭房间内的{}所有{}实例，唯一的例外是那些没有为其分配精灵或掩码索引的实例。您还可以告诉它在启用时使用精确的碰撞检查，但请注意，这需要所有实例都启用精确的掩码，并且由于必须进行大量处理，当涉及许多实例时，会大大减慢游戏速度。这通常应该在实例的步进事件中进行，但也可以在碰撞事件中选择性地使用，如下面的代码示例所示。"
