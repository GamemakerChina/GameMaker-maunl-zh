What this means is that it returns the actual device definition of the y position that is being touched, {}not{} the {}GameMaker{} one, and as such will ignore things like view position and scaling. Note that the maximum number of device touches that can be detected will depend very much on the device being used and the OS it runs":"此函数返回设备上触摸的原始y位置。这意味着它返回被触摸的y位置的实际设备定义 ，{}不是{}GameMaker{}一个，因此将忽略视图位置和缩放。请注意，可以检测到的最大设备触摸数量将在很大程度上取决于正在使用的设备及其运行的操作系统",
