    "This function returns {}true{} or {}false{} depending on whether the device touch that you specify has been released or not. The device argument refers to the device touch number, which can be from 0 to n and note that the maximum number of touches that can be detected will depend very much on the device being used and the OS it runs (most devices will support at least 4 simultaneous touches). This function is only triggered once by the actual releasing action, and the constants listed {}on this page{} can be used to check for the mouse buttons. Note that {}mb_right{} will only have been detected if a double tap touch is detected and held on the second tap before release (this behavior can be disabled using the function {}{}device_mouse_dbclick_enable(){}{}).":"根据您指定的设备触摸是否已释放，此函数返回{}true{}或{}false{}。设备参数指的是设备触摸号，可以从0到n，请注意，可以检测到的最大触摸数将在很大程度上取决于所使用的设备及其运行的操作系统 (大多数设备将支持至少4个同时触摸)。此函数仅由实际的释放动作触发一次，并且{}此页{}中列出的常量{}可用于检查鼠标按钮。请注意，{}mb_right{}只有在释放前第二次点击时检测到并保持双击触摸时才会被检测到 (可以使用{}device_mouse_dbclick_enable(){}{}函数禁用此行为)。"
