    "This function will return the name of the path that is referenced as a string. The name is whatever has been used to define the path in the editor or (if the path has been created through a code function) it will return a string with the format \" {}_newpathXX{}\" where \"{}XX{}\" is the number of the path generated, starting at 0 and incrementing by one every time a new path is created. Please note that this is {}only{} a string and cannot be used to reference the path directly - for that you would need the {}path index ID{}. You can, however, use this string to get the {}path index ID{} using the returned string along with the function {}{}asset_get_index(){}{}.":"此函数将返回作为字符串引用的路径的名称。该名称是用于在编辑器中定义路径的名称，或者 (如果路径是通过代码函数创建的) 它将返回格式为 \"{}_newpathXX{}\" 的字符串，其中 \"{}XX{}\" 是生成的路径的编号，从 0 开始，每次创建新路径时加一。请注意，这 {} 只是 {} 一个字符串，不能用于直接引用路径 - 为此，您需要 {} 路径索引 ID{}。不过，您可以使用返回的字符串以及函数 {10}{11}asset_get_index(){12}{13}，使用此字符串来获取 {} 路径索引 ID{}。",
