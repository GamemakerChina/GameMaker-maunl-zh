    "The index of the path to change.":"要更改的路径的索引。",
    "This would reverse the order in which all points on the given path&nbsp;are processed.":"这将颠倒处理给定路径上所有点的顺序。",
    "With this function you can reverse the order in which the individual path points are numbered, so, for example, if the path has 5 points, point 0 would become point 4, point 1 would be point 3 and point 2 would not be changed. The actual position of\n    the points remains the same, only the order in which they are processed is changed. {}This function changes the actual path asset{}, and so will permanently affect how the path is used by all instances in the game from the moment the\n    function is used until the end of the game.&nbsp;If this is not what you require, then you should use a function like {}{}path_duplicate(){}{} to create a copy of the path first, then call this function\n    on the duplicated asset (don\u0027t forget to call {}{}path_delete(){}{} on the asset when it is no longer required).":"使用此功能，您可以反转各个路径点的编号顺序，因此，例如，如果路径有 5 个点，点 0 将变为点 4，点 1 将为点 3，点 2 不会改变。实际位置\n点保持不变，仅更改其处理顺序。{}该函数更改实际路径资产{}，因此将永久影响从游戏中所有实例开始的路径使用方式。\n函数一直使用到游戏结束。如果这不是您需要的，那么您应该使用像{}{}path_duplicate(){}{}这样的函数来首先创建路径的副本，然后调用该函数\n在重复资产上(当不再需要时，别忘了在资产上调用{}{}path_delete(){}{})。"
