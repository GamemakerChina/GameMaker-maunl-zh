    "The above code checks an area in front of the instance for a collision with the object \"obj_Player\" and if there is one, it sets the instance back to the previous position it occupied on the current path, as assigned by the function {}{}path_start(){}{}.":"上面的代码检查实例前面的区域是否与对象\"obj_Player\"发生冲突，如果存在冲突，它将实例设置回它在当前路径上所占用的先前位置，如函数{}{}path_start(){}{}所分配的。",
    "This variable can be used to get or to set the position of an instance along its current path in the previous step, and is a normalised value between 0 and 1 ie: 0 is the start position of the path and 1 would be the end position. It is similar to the {}{}xprevious{}{}&nbsp;and {}{}yprevious{}{}&nbsp;variables in how it works, only it is specific for paths. It can be useful for things like temporarily stopping a path follower if something is in the way (see the example code below).":"此变量可用于在上一步中获取或设置实例沿其当前路径的位置，是介于 0 和 1 之间的归一化值，即：0 为路径的起始位置，1为结束位置。它的工作原理与{}{}xprevious{}{}和{}{}yprevious{}{}变量相似，只针对路径。它可以很有用，例如，在遇到阻碍时暂时停止路径跟随器(参见下面的示例代码)。"
