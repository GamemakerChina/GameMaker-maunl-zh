    "When defining a font in {}GameMaker{}, you can define a range of characters to include. This is because the font itself is not actually included with your game (for legal reasons) but an {}image{} of the font is included on a texture page and that is what your game will use (just like any other graphics asset). This means that you will want to keep the number of characters that you use to a minimum and specify only the range of characters that your game will need so as to keep texture memory as optimised as possible. This function can be used to find the starting character (as an ASCII value) that was used when your font asset was added to your game.":"在{}GameMaker{}中定义字体时，您可以定义要包含的字符范围。这是因为字体本身实际上并不包含在您的游戏中(出于法律原因)，而是一个{}图像{}字体包含在纹理页面中，这是您的游戏将使用的字体(就像任何其他图形资源一样)。这意味着您需要将使用的字符数保持在最小值，并仅指定您的游戏将需要，以便保持纹理内存尽可能优化。此函数可用于查找将字体资源添加到游戏中时使用的起始字符(作为ASCII值)。",
    "{}{}NOTE{} {}Due to changes in the way fonts are handled, this function will {}always{} return 32, as {}GameMaker{} enforces the space character (32) into the font and doesn\u0027t allow characters with codes lower than 32 either. New functions to do similar tasks will be added in a future update.":"{}{}注意{}{}由于字体处理方式的变化，该函数将{}始终返回{}32，因为{}GameMaker{}在字体中强制使用空格字符(32)，并且不会允许代码小于32的字符。执行类似任务的新功能将在未来更新中添加。"
