    "By setting the x (and y) values you can make the object jump around the room to the position of your choice, or you can add and subtract to them by smaller amounts to give the illusion of movement without actually using the built in {}{}speed{}{} and {}{}direction{}{} functions. This should be taken into account when making your games as often one type of movement lends itself to a particular style of game-play more than another.":"通过设置 x(和 y)值，可以使对象在房间周围跳跃到您选择的位置，或者可以以较小的量对其进行加减，从而产生移动的幻觉，而无需实际使用内置的{}{}速度{}{}和{}{}方向{}{}函数。在制作游戏时应该考虑到这一点，因为一种运动通常更适合一种特定的游戏风格。",

    "The x value of an instance is the horizontal position in the current room, measured in pixels. This value can be either 0, positive or minus, where 0 is the left hand side of the room and moving right increases x, moving left decreases x (a negative value for x means that the instance has gone outside the left side of the room). You can even give x a real value like 12.345, but as you cannot get .345 of a pixel, the instance may not appear to have moved, although these values will be maintained and used internally by {}GameMaker{} and are perfectly valid.":"实例的x值是当前房间中的水平位置，单位为像素。此值可以是 0，正或负，其中 0 是房间的左手边，向右移动会增加 x，向左移动会减少 x(负x的值表示实例已超出房间的左侧)。你甚至可以给x一个像12.345那样的实值，但是你不能得到。 345，实例可能没有移动，尽管这些值将被保持由{}GameMaker{}内部使用，并且完全有效。"
