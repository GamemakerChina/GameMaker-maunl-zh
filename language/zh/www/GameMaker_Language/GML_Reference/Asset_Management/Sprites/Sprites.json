    "Sprites are generally the visual representations of objects within the game you are creating, although they can be used for many other purposes. A sprite is either a single image, or a set of images that, when played one after another, looks like a looping animation. Sprites can be created in many formats, with the \"traditional\" sprite being made up of frames of pixel images, imported into {}GameMaker{} as {}*.png{} files. However you can also import {}vector{} sprites that have been saved in the {}*.swf{} format, or {}skeletal animation{} sprites that have been saved out as {}*.json{} files with accompanying {}*.atlas{} and {}*.png{} files (for more information on these types of image files and how to import them into {}GameMaker{} please see the section {}Importing Non-Bitmap Sprites{}).":"精灵通常是您正在创建的游戏中对象的视觉表示，尽管它们可以用于许多其他目的。精灵是单个图像，或者是一组图像，当一个接一个地播放时，看起来像是循环动画。可以以多种格式创建精灵，“传统” 精灵由像素图像帧组成，并以{}* 的身份导入{}GameMaker{}。png{}文件。但是，您也可以导入已保存在{}* 中的{}向量{}精灵。swf{}格式，或{}骨架动画{}已被保存为{}* 的精灵。带有随附{}* 的json{}文件。图集{}和{}*。png{}文件 (有关这些类型的图像文件以及如何将其导入{}GameMaker{}的更多信息，请参见{}导入非位图精灵{}一节)。",
