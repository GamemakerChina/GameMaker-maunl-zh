This yoffset is returned in pixels and will be dependent on the {}{}image_yscale{}{}, so that (for example) if a square 32x32 sprite is defined as having the y origin at 16, when that sprite is scaled by 2 this variable will return 32. If you need the un-scaled yoffset you should use {}{}sprite_get_yoffset(){}{}.":"此{}只读{}变量返回已指定给实例的精灵的局部yOffset(在Sprite编辑器中定义的原点的y分量)。此yOffset以像素为单位返回，并将依赖于{}{}image_yscale{}{}，因此(例如)如果将正方形32x32 sprite定义为具有16处的y原点，则当该sprite缩放2时，此变量将返回32。如果你需要未缩放的YOffset，你应该使用{}{}sprite_get_yoffset(){}{}。"
