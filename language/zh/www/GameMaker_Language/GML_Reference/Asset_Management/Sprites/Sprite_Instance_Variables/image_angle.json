    "This value sets the angle (rotation) of the sprite and is measured in degrees, with the right being 0º, up being 90º, left being 180º and down being 270º. Set this variable to 0 to reset the sprite to be drawn as was defined in the sprite editor. Please note that for changes in this variable to be visible, the instance should have either {}no{} draw event (and so {}GameMaker{} will default draw the sprite) or be drawn using one of the extended drawing functions like {}{}draw_self(){}{}&nbsp;or {}{}draw_sprite_ext(){}{}.":"该值设置精灵的角度 (旋转)，以度为单位，右侧为 0°，向上为 90°，左侧为 180°，向下为 270°。将此变量设置为 0 以重置要绘制的精灵，如精灵编辑器中所定义的那样。请注意，要使该变量的更改可见，实例应具有 {} 无 {} 绘制事件 (因此 {}GameMaker{} 将默认绘制精灵) 或使用扩展绘图函数之一进行绘制，例如 {}{}draw_self(){}{} 或 {}{}draw_sprite_ext(){}{}。"
