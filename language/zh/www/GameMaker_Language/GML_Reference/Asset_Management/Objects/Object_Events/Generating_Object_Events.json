    "{}GameMaker{} is completely event driven, and that all actions happen as the result of certain events that are triggered in a specific order or by a specific occurrence within the game. There are a number of different events, each one with a specific task or timing and some of them are even split into separate \"sub\" events. Normally these events are run by {}GameMaker{} when it detects an in-game trigger, or every game tick (as is the case with the step and draw events), but you can also apply an event to an instance in the current room from within a piece of code.":"{}GameMaker{}完全是事件驱动的，所有动作都是以特定顺序或游戏内特定事件触发的特定事件的结果发生的。有许多不同的事件，每个事件都有特定的任务或时间安排，有些甚至被分成单独的\"子\"事件。通常，当{}GameMaker{}检测到一个游戏触发器或每个游戏滴答时，这些事件由{}GameMaker{}运行(步骤和绘制事件也是如此)，但您也可以从一段代码中将事件应用于当前房间中的实例。"
