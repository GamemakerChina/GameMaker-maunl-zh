The function will return {}true{} if loading is initiated and {}false{} if the group ID is invalid, or it has already been flagged for loading. The function is asynchronous so your game will continue to run while the audio is loaded in the background. This means that it will also trigger an {}Asynchronous Load/Save Event{} to inform you that the whole group has been loaded into memory and the sounds can now be used.":"此功能会将标记为属于给定音频组的所有声音载入存储器。如果启动加载，函数将返回{}true{};如果组ID无效或已标记加载，则函数将返回{}false{}。该功能是异步的，因此在后台加载音频时，您的游戏将继续运行。这意味着它还会触发{}异步加载/保存事件{}，通知您整个组已加载到内存中，现在可以使用声音。"
