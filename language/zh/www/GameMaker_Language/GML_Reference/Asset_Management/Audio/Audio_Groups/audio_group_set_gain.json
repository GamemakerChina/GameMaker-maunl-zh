    "The time is measured in milliseconds, and the function requires that you input a final level of gain for the group to have reached by the end of that time. This gain can be between 0 (silent) and 1 (full volume) and the scale is linear, such that a value of 0.5 would be half volume. To instantly change the gain, simply set the time argument to 0. Note that on some platforms you can have a gain of greater than 1, although a value of 1 is considered \"full volume\" and anything greater may introduce audio clipping.":"时间以毫秒为单位，该函数要求您输入组在该时间结束时达到的最终增益级别。该增益可以在0(无声)和1(全音量)之间，并且比例是线性的，使得值0.5将是音量的一半。要立即更改增益，只需将时间参数设置为0。请注意，在某些平台上，您的增益可能大于1，尽管值1被视为\"最大音量\"，任何更大的值都可能引入音频剪辑。",
