    "This function will return the current gain value for the given sound. The sound can either be one referenced from an index for an individual sound being played which has been stored in a variable when using the {}{}audio_play_sound(){}{} or {}{}audio_play_sound_at(){}{} functions, or an actual sound asset from the Asset Browser. Gain is usually calculated as a value from 0 to 1, but on some platforms you can have a gain of greater than 1, although a value of 1 is considered \"full volume\" and anything greater may introduce audio clipping.":"此函数将返回给定声音的当前增益值。声音可以是使用{}{}audio_play_sound(){}{}或{}{}audio_play_sound_at(){}{}函数时存储在变量中的正在播放的单个声音的索引引用的声音，也可以是来自资源浏览器的实际声音资源。增益通常计算为0至1的值，但在某些平台上，增益可以大于1，但1被视为\"全音量\"，任何较大值都可能引入音频削波。"
