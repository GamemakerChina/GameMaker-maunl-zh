    "An important thing to note when creating room layers is that {}you can have multiple different element types on one layer{}. So, for example, you may have a layer for enemies, and on that layer have the enemy instances as well as certain sprite assets that are only related to that enemy. Or you could have a background element with a tile map element to create the look of a room. This is not permitted in the room editor, but when creating things dynamically you can do this, which is why functions like {}{}layer_get_all_elements(){}{}&nbsp;exist.":"创建房间图层时需要注意的是，{}在一个层上可以有多个不同的元素类型{}。 所以，例如，你可能有一个敌人的层，在这个层上有敌人实例以及某些与敌人有关的精灵资源。或者，您可以使用带有平铺地图元素的背景元素来创建房间的外观。这在房间编辑器中是不允许的，但在动态创建对象时，可以执行此操作，这就是为什么存在类似{}{}layer_get_all_elements(){}{}的函数的原因。",
    "Next, we have a series of functions that can be used to change rooms and their contents or even create new rooms and add to them. It should be noted that these functions should {}never be run from within the room that you wish to change{}, but rather be run from an instance in another room first. Also note that if you change any room asset in this way, the change is&nbsp;{}permanent{} and will be maintained for the entire duration of the game, even if you call the room_restart() function (closing and restarting the game will reset the room properties though).":"接下来，我们有一系列函数可以用来更改房间及其内容，甚至可以创建新房间并添加到其中。应该注意的是，这些函数{}不应在你想要更改的房间内运行{}，而应先从另一个房间的实例中运行。另请注意，如果你以这种方式更改任何房间资源，则更改将是{}永久的{}，即使你调用了 room_restart() 函数(但关闭和重启游戏会重置房间属性)，更改将在游戏的整个持续时间内保持不变。",
