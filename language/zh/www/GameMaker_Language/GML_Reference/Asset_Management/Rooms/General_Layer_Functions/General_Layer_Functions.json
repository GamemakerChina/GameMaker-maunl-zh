    "The {}GameMaker{} {}Room Editor{} permits you to add {}layers{} of different assets to your room. These can be tile maps (using tile sets), backgrounds, sprites or sequences, and instances, but note that unlike the room editor, you are {}not{} limited to a single asset type per layer, and can add multiple asset types to the same layer - for example you can have a background and a tile map all on the same layer. Note that each asset that is added to a layer is considered an {}element{}&nbsp;of that layer.":"{}GameMaker{}{}房间编辑器{}允许您将{}层{}不同资源添加到您的房间。这些可以是平铺贴图(使用平铺集)、背景、精灵或序列和实例，但请注意，与房间编辑器不同，您{}不限于每个层的单个资源类型，并且可以向同一层添加多个资源类型。例如，您可以在同一层上拥有背景和平铺贴图。请注意，添加到层的每个资源都被视为该层的{}元素{}。",

    "We also have a couple of extra functions relating to targeting layers in a different room. It may be that you want to change something in a room that is not the current room, or maybe you want to generate rooms procedurally, or any number of things.
