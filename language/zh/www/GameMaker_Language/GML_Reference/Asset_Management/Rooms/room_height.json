    "This variable holds the height of the current room in pixels. You can change this variable to change the height of the room at any time, and changes will be applied to the bottom of the room, as the origin is considered to be the top left corner. So, for example, if the room is 480px in height and you set it to 640px, the room will be expanded downwards with an extra 180px added to the bottom.":"此变量保存当前房间的高度(以像素为单位)。您可以随时更改此变量以更改房间的高度，并且更改将应用于房间的底部，因为原点被视为左上角。例如，如果房间的高度为480px，而您将其设置为640px，则房间将向下扩展，并在底部添加额外的180px."
