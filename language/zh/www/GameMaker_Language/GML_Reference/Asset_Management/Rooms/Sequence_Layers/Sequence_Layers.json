    "In this section we have the functions that are used for adding, removing and editing how {}Sequences{} behave in a game room in relation to the {}layer{} they are on. It should be noted that sequences are similar to objects, in that when one is created on a layer in a room, it is considered an {}instance{} of the main sequence {}object{} from the {}Asset Browser{}. So, when you add a sequence to a layer in a room, you are creating an {}instance{} of the base sequence object, and this sequence instance is added as an {}element{} within a room layer. The sequence instance is what controls things like playback speed and direction, and will itself contain another sequence data {}struct{} which is what contains the actual sequence track data. This is important, as the functions listed below will reference the sequence {}element ID{} (the ID of the sequence {}on the layer{}) as well as the sequence {}instance ID{} (the actual ID of the sequence that is being referenced by the element) and the sequence data {}struct{} (which contains all the sequence data).":"在本节中，我们提供了用于添加、删除和编辑{}序列{}在游戏室中相对于它们所在的{}层{}的行为的函数。应当注意，序列与对象相似，因为当在房间中的层上创建序列时，它被认为是来自{}资产浏览器{}的主序列{}对象{}的{}实例{}。 因此，当将序列添加到房间中的层时，您正在创建基本序列对象的{}实例{}，并且此序列实例被添加为房间层中的{}元素{}。序列实例是控制回放速度和方向之类的东西，并且本身将包含另一个序列数据{}结构{}，该结构包含实际的序列轨迹数据。这一点很重要，因为下面列出的函数将引用序列{}元素ID{}(层{}上的序列{}的ID)以及序列{}实例ID{}(被元素引用的序列的实际ID)和序列数据{}结构{}(包含所有序列数据)。",
    "There are also additional functions available for dealing with the contents of sequences and for defining your own. You can find a complete list of these functions in the following section:":"还有一些附加功能可用于处理序列的内容和定义自己的。您可以在以下部分找到这些功能的完整列表："
