    "This function will create a new, empty, room and add it to your game, returning its index to be stored in a variable for all further codes that deal with this room. Note that each room is permanently added to the game until the executable is closed, ie: {}rooms added through code cannot be deleted again{}. This has important implications for memory use and so you should use this function with care.":"此函数将创建一个新的空房间，并将其添加到您的游戏中，返回其索引以存储在一个变量中，用于处理此房间的所有其他代码。请注意，每个房间都会永久添加到游戏中，直到可执行文件关闭，即：{}无法再次删除通过代码添加的会议室{}。这对内存使用有重要的影响，因此您应该小心使用此函数。",
    "This will create a new room and store its index in the variable \"global.myroom\". It will then set its width to 640 pixels, its height to 480 pixels, and its persistence to {}false{}.":"这将创建一个新房间并将其索引存储在变量\"global.myroom\"中。然后将其宽度设置为640像素，高度设置为480像素，持久性设置为{}false{}。",
    "{}NOTE{}: New rooms are not part of usual room ordering, so they do not have a \"previous\" or \"next\" room (meaning that the functions {}{}{}room_next(){}{}{}&nbsp;and {}{}{}room_previous(){}{}{} will not work). To jump from the added room to another, you must use the index of the room itself.":"{}注意{}：新客房不是通常客房订购的一部分，因此它们没有\"上一个\"或\"下一个\"客房(这意味着功能{}{}{}房间_next(){}{}{}和{}{}{}房间_foreous(){}{}{}将不起作用)。要从添加的房间跳转到另一个房间，必须使用房间本身的索引。"
