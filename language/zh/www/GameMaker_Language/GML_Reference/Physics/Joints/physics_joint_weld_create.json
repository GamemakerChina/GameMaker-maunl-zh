    "Since the weld joint is flexible and will bend and flex when under any stress, you can set the oscillation frequency (in Hz) as well as the damping ratio for the joint to get different effects - you may need to play with these values to fine tune them and it is recommended that you start off with smaller values and increment them until you get the effect that you desire.":"由于焊接关节是柔性的，并且在任何应力下都会弯曲和弯曲，因此可以设置振荡频率 (以 Hz 为单位) 以及关节的阻尼比，以获得不同的效果-您可能需要使用这些值来微调它们，建议您从较小的值开始并增加它们，直到获得所需的效果。",

The weld joint will permit flexing between the two joined fixtures but without the stretching associated with, for example, a distance joint, and will always try to \"spring\" back to the reference angle when put under any stress or load. You define the point in the room where the joint should be created, as well as the angle that you wish the joint to try and maintain at all times, as shown in the image below:":"焊接关节设计用于将两个固定装置连接在一起，形成牢固而灵活的焊接。焊接关节将允许在两个连接的固定装置之间弯曲，但没有例如与距离关节相关的拉伸，并且当在任何应力或载荷下时，总是试图\"弹回\"参考角。定义房间中应创建关节的点，以及希望关节始终尝试并保持的角度，如下图所示：",

    "{}As you can see, the anchor points are specified as room coordinates so care must be taken when defining them, especially if the instances are being created at the same time as the joints rather than being placed in the room through the room editor. You should also realise that the joints are created independently of the size of the sprite of the instances or the fixtures they have attached. So, if you create a weld joint somewhere other than the origin of the instance, it is still valid and will constrain the two instances relative to the position at which it was created.":"{}如您所见，锚点被指定为房间坐标，因此在定义它们时必须小心，尤其是如果实例与关节同时创建，而不是通过房间编辑器放置在房间中。您还应该意识到，关节的创建与实例的子画面大小或它们附着的装置的大小无关。因此，如果在实例原点以外的位置创建焊接关节，它仍然有效，并将相对于创建它的位置约束这两个实例。"
