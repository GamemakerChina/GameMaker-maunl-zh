    "A viscous particle is one that exhibits \"clinginess\" or \"stickiness\", like oil. Viscous particles will clump and stick together more.":"粘性颗粒是表现出\"粘性\"或\"粘性\"的颗粒，就像油一样。粘性颗粒会更多地聚集并粘在一起。",
    "A zombie particle is one that will be destroyed after a single step with all others flagged in this way.":"僵尸粒子是一个在一个步骤之后将被销毁的粒子，所有其他粒子都以这种方式标记。",
    "Colour-mixing particles take on some of the colour of other particles with which they collide. Note that if only one of the two colliding particles is a colour-mixing one, the other particle retains its pre-collision colour.":"混色粒子具有其他粒子碰撞时的一些颜色。请注意，如果两个碰撞粒子中只有一个是颜色混合粒子，则另一个粒子保留其碰撞前的颜色。",

    "Other than the flags, you can also set the position in the room to create the particle at, the initial horizontal and vertical velocity, the initial colour and alpha, as well as the user {}category{}. The colour and alpha values are only used when drawing the particle using the function {}{}physics_particle_draw(){}{}, but the category value is used in multiple other functions. This value is an arbitrary integer value that you give each particle that you want to have similar properties, and it can be used to set flags later for that specific category as well as a number of other things. For example, if you have defined a \"water\" and an \"oil\" particle, you would give all those particles flagged as \"water\" the user category of 1 and all those particles created as \"oil\" the user category of 2, permitting you to later target a single category to change it\u0027s flags or get specific data.":"除了标志之外，还可以在房间中设置创建粒子的位置、初始水平和垂直速度、初始颜色和 Alpha 以及用户 {} 类别 {}。颜色和 Alpha 值仅在使用函数 {}{}physics_particle_draw(){}{} 绘制粒子时使用，但类别值用于多个其他函数。该值是一个任意整数值，您可以为每个粒子提供希望具有类似属性的值，以后可以使用该值为该特定类别以及许多其他类别设置标志。例如，如果定义了\"水\"和\"油\"粒子，则会将标记为\"水\"的所有粒子的用户类别指定为 1，将创建为\"油\"的所有粒子的用户类别指定为 2，允许您以后针对单个类别更改其标记或获取特定数据。",

    "Spring particles produce the effect of being attached to one another, as if by a spring. Particles created with this flag are \"connected\" in pairs, with each particle being connected to the one that was closest to it at the time of creation. Once paired, particles do not change \"partners\" , and the farther an external force pulls them from one another, the greater the power with which they will collide when that external force is removed. Note that no matter how far paired particles get from each another, the connection between them will not snap.":"弹簧粒子产生相互连接的效果，就像弹簧一样。使用此标志创建的粒子成对\"连接\"，每个粒子都连接到创建时最接近它的粒子。一旦配对，粒子就不会改变\"伙伴关系\"，并且外力将它们彼此拉得越远，当外力被消除时，它们将碰撞的功率就越大。请注意，无论配对的粒子彼此之间的距离有多远，它们之间的连接都不会断开。",
    "Tensile particles are used to produce the effect of surface tension, or the taut curvature on the surface of a body of liquid. They might be used, for example, to create the surface tension you would see on a drop of water. Once the tension is broken, the particles bounce as if they were elastic, but also continue to attract each other. As a result, particles tend to form clusters as they bounce.":"拉伸粒子用于在液体表面产生表面张力或拉伸曲率的影响。例如，它们可用于创建在水滴上看到的表面张力。一旦张力被打破,颗粒就像弹性一样反弹,而且还继续相互吸引。因此，粒子在反弹时倾向于形成簇。",

    "These flags use bit-masking to create a final output value that is then checked to set the different basic properties of the particle (with the base property always being that of {}phy_particle_flag_water{}).
