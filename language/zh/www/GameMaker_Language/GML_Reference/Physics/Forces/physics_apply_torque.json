    "The code above will rotate the instance to the anti-clockwise (to the left) with a torque of 100Nm when the left arrow key is pressed.":"按下左箭头键时，上述代码将以 100 牛顿/米(Nm) 的扭矩逆时针(向左)旋转实例。",
    "The torque (in Newton metres) to be applied":"要施加的扭矩(以牛顿/米为单位)",
    "When we talk about torque, we are generally talking about the tendency of a force or impulse to rotate an instance about its centre of mass, but in {}GameMaker{} you can also apply torque independently to an instance, causing it to rotate in a given direction. How much torque you apply to get the desired rotation all depends on the size and density of the fixture you assign to your instance, as both these properties go towards defining its mass, which defines its inertia, which affects torque! The general rule of thumb is that if an instance has a lot of inertia, you will need a lot of torque to get it to start rotating. It should also be noted that other factors like gravity and collisions can also affect the torque of an instance. Here is an image to help explain:":"当我们讨论扭矩时，我们通常讨论的是力或冲量围绕实例的质心旋转的趋势，但在 {}GameMaker{} 中，您也可以对实例单独施加扭矩，使其沿给定方向旋转。应用多少扭矩来获得所需的旋转取决于指定给实例的装置的大小和密度，因为这两个属性都将定义其质量，质量定义了其惯性，惯性会影响扭矩！一般的经验法则是，如果实例具有很大的惯性，则需要很大的扭矩才能使其开始旋转。还应注意，其他因素(如重力和碰撞)也会影响实例的扭矩。以下是一张图片，可帮助您进行说明：",
    "{}As you can see, the amount of torque you need to rotate the object depends on the underlying mass and inertia that it gives. This is all calculated for you by {}GameMaker{} based on the size and density of the fixture that is assigned to the instance when it is created. Also note that for anti-clockwise rotation, the value should be negative.":"{}正如您所看到的，旋转对象所需的扭矩大小取决于其提供的底层质量和惯性。{}GameMaker{} 将根据创建实例时分配给该实例的装置的大小和密度为您计算这一切。另请注意，对于逆时针旋转，该值应为负值。"
