    "When working with physics you need to apply not only gravity to objects, but forces as well. A force is any influence that causes an object to undergo a change in speed, a change in direction, or a change in shape, and is defined in the {}GameMaker{} physics world the same as we define gravity, by getting the vector from the two xforce/yforce components. It should be noted that forces are not applied to the center of mass of the object, but rather at a point in the room and they will change the direction and speed as well as the torque (spin) dependant on any other forces that are working on the object (like gravity). Here is an example image to help illustrate:":"使用物理时，不仅需要将重力应用于对象，还需要将力应用于对象。力是导致对象发生速度、方向或形状变化的任何影响，通过从两个xforce/y力分量获取矢量，在 {}GameMaker{} 物理世界中定义的力与我们定义的重力相同。需要注意的是，力不是施加在物体的重心上，而是施加在房间的某个点上，它们将改变方向和速度以及扭矩(旋转)，这取决于在物体上工作的任何其他力(如重力)。下面是一个有助于说明的示例图像：",
    "{}In the above example the spring object at the bottom has created a force on the ball object getting it to move in a different direction. The exact force is defined by the vector we get from the components xforce/yforce in relation to the xpos/ypos coordinates - which simply means that the force is calculated as the distance from xpos/ypos to xforce/yforce in Newtons (a Newton being defined as the amount of net force required to accelerate a mass of one kilogram at a rate of one meter per second squared)and the direction is the angle that we get from xpos/ypos to xforce/yforce. The code for a collision like the above would go in the collision event of the spring object and would look something like that provided in the example below.":"{}在上面的示例中，底部的弹簧对象在球对象上创建了一个力，使球对象沿不同的方向移动。精确力由我们从分量 xforce/yforce 相对于 xpos/ypos 坐标得到的矢量定义-这简单地意味着力被计算为从 xpos/ypos 到 xforce/yforce 的距离，单位为牛顿(牛顿被定义为以每秒平方米的速率加速一公斤质量所需的净力量)，并且方向是我们从 xpos/ypos 到 xforce/yforce 的角度。类似上述的碰撞代码将在弹簧对象的碰撞事件中出现，看起来类似于下面示例中提供的代码。",
