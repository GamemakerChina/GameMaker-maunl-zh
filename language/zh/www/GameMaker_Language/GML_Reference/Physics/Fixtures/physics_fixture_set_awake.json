    "When you start a room with physics, or bind fixtures to instances, the fixtures are always considered to be \"awake\"... that is to say, they are processing events and interacting with the surrounding instances. However this can sometimes lead\n    to problems, especially if you have a number of instances with fixtures that are side by side when a room starts (think of a tower made of various instances with fixtures) as with them being \"awake\" they will move and possibly change position\n    due to the sudden start of gravity and collisions affecting them. In these cases you can use this function to flag the fixture as been \"asleep\", in which case it will not be processing anything when it is first created in the room.":"当您使用物理创建一个房间，或者将装置绑定到实例时，装置总是被认为是\"醒着的\"...也就是说，它们处理事件并与周围的实例交互。然而，这有时会导致一些问题，尤其是当房间启动时，如果有许多带有并排装置的实例(想象一下由带有装置的各种实例组成的塔)，因为它们处于\"醒着\"状态，它们会移动，并可能由于重力的突然启动和影响它们的碰撞而改变位置。在这些情况下，您可以使用此功能将装置标记为\"睡眠\"，在这种情况下，当装置首次在房间中创建时，它将不会处理任何内容。",
