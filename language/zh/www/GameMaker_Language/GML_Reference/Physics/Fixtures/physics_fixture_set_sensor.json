    "Some times you will want your game to detect and recognise when two instances with fixtures collide, but not have any physical reaction to the collision. This can be done by converting the fixture into a sensor, which basically means that they will generate a collision event but with no physical response so that you can use these instances as \"triggers\" for other events to happen in the game room. Any fixture can be flagged as a sensor, and it makes no difference if the instance it is bound to is static or in movement.":"有时，您会希望游戏检测并识别两个具有装置的实例发生碰撞时，但对碰撞没有任何物理反应。这可以通过将装置转换为传感器来完成，这基本上意味着它们将生成碰撞事件，但没有物理响应，这样您就可以将这些实例用作游戏室中其他事件发生的\"触发器\"。任何装置都可以标记为传感器，如果它绑定到的实例是静态的或移动的，则没有区别。",
    "The code above will turn the sensor state of the fixture indexed in \"fix_Cloud\" to true.":"上面的代码将使 \"fix_Cloud\" 中索引的装置的传感器状态变为 true。",
    "the index of the fixture":"装置的索引",
    "whether a fixture is a sensor (true) or not (false)":"装置是否是传感器 (true) 或不是 (false)。",
    "{}NOTE{}: A sensor fixture will fire off the collision event when the collision {}first occurs only{}, meaning you don\u0027t get a stream of collision events as the two bodies continue to overlap (which is what would traditionally occur). If they stop overlapping and overlap subsequently there will be another collision event triggered.":"{}注意{}：当第一次碰撞{}仅发生{}时，传感器装置将触发碰撞事件，这意味着由于两个实体继续重叠(传统上会发生这种情况)，您不会收到碰撞事件流。如果它们随后停止重叠并重叠，则会触发另一个冲突事件。",
