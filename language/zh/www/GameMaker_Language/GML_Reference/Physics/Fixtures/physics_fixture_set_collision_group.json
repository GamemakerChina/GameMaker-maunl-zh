    "Once you have created your fixture you can define it as being part of a collision group. This means that you can tell instances with that fixture to {}always{} collide or {}never{} collide with other instance that have fixtures bound to them with the same collision group. The values that can be assigned are based on positive or negative numbers, with 0 being the default value (meaning that the instance with this fixture setting is ignored unless a collision event is created for it). Here is an image to help explain:":"创建装置后，可以将其定义为碰撞组的一部分。这意味着您可以告诉具有该设备的实例{}始终{}发生碰撞或{}从不{}与具有绑定到具有相同碰撞组的设备的其他实例发生碰撞。可以指定的值基于正数或负数，0 为默认值 (意味着除非为其创建碰撞事件，否则将忽略具有此设备设置的实例)。以下是一张图片，可帮助您进行说明：",
    "The code above will set the fixture indexed in the variable \"fix_Wheel\" to be part of the group \"-1\".":"上述代码将变量 \"fix_Wheel\" 中索引的夹具设置为组 \"-1\" 的一部分。",
    "The fixture that is to be bound":"要绑定的夹具",
    "The group that this fixture is assigned to (either a positive value, 0, or a negative value)":"此装置指定给的组 (正值、0 或负值)",
    "{}As you can see, setting collision groups can be very useful to create complex physical bodies that interact with the physical world around them, but not with each other. However, it should be noted that due to the complexity of calculating collisions based on groups like this, it is recommend that you try to keep the number of groups in use in any one room to an absolute minimum.":"{}正如您所看到的，设置碰撞组对于创建复杂的物理实体非常有用，这些物理实体与它们周围的物理世界相互作用，而不是彼此相互作用。但是，需要注意的是，由于基于这样的组计算碰撞的复杂性，建议您尽量将任何一个房间中正在使用的组数保持在绝对最小值。",
    "{}{}NOTE{}{}&nbsp;The values for the collision group can range from -32,768 to 32,767 (both {}inclusive{}).":"{}{}注意{}{} 碰撞组的值可以在 -32,768 到 32,767 之间 (包括{}全部{})。"
