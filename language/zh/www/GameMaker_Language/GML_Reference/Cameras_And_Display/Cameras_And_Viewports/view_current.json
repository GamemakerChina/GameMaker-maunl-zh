    "This {}read only{} variable is only valid in the {}{}Draw Event{}{} and returns the current view port being rendered. The return value will change during the draw event when you have various views as the draw event is called {}once for each view port in succession{}. So when (for example) you are using view port[0] and view port[1] in your game room, the draw event for {}ALL{} instances will be run twice, once for each port, and with this variable you can check to see what view is currently being drawn. In general, this is used to only render specific details to a single port when multiple view ports are visible in the room at the same time. See the example code below.":"此{}只读{}变量仅在{}{}绘制事件{}{}中有效，并返回正在呈现的当前视口。当连续为{}每个视口{}调用一次绘制事件时，如果您具有各种视图，则在绘制事件期间返回值将更改。因此，当(例如)您在游戏室中使用 viewport[0] 和 viewport[1] 时，{}所有{}实例的绘制事件将运行两次，每个端口一次，您可以使用此变量检查当前正在绘制的视图。通常，这仅用于在房间中同时可见多个视口时将特定详细信息渲染到单个端口。请参见下面的示例代码。"
