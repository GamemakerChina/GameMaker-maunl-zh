    "The above code sets the width and height of the camera view to be the same as the width and height of the view port.":"上述代码将相机视图的宽度和高度设置为与视口的宽度和高度相同。",
    "This variable can be used to get or to set the height of the specified view port. The height of the view port (or combined view ports if more than one are active) define the height of the game window or background canvas {}at the start of the game{}, so changing this value after the game has started will have no visible effect on the game window size unless called along with the function {}{}window_set_size(){}{}. If you have a larger or smaller port size than that assigned to the camera, then the camera view will be scaled down - or up - to fit, as illustrated by the image below.":"此变量可用于获取或设置指定视口的高度。视口的高度(如果有多个视口处于活动状态)定义了{}游戏开始时{}游戏窗口或背景画布的高度，因此在游戏开始后更改此值将不会对游戏窗口大小产生可见影响，除非随函数 {}{}window_set_size(){}{} 一起调用。如果您的端口大小大于或小于分配给相机的端口大小，则相机视图将按比例缩小或缩小以适应游戏窗口大小，如下图所示。"
