    "When drawing things in a room, you\u0027ll often require a more granular control over exactly how drawing will be done. You may wish for there to be no alpha blending, or you may require culling, or you may need to switch texture interpolation on or off. All this is possible - and a lot more! - using the GPU controller functions listed below. Note that most of these functions are global in scope and once set or changed will affect how everything is drawn from then onwards.":"在房间中绘制东西时，通常需要对绘制的确切方式进行更精细的控制。您可能希望没有Alpha混合，或者您可能需要消隐，或者您可能需要打开或关闭纹理插值。所有这一切都是可能的——而且还有更多！-使用下面列出的Gpu控制器函数。请注意，这些函数中的大多数都是全局函数，一旦设置或更改，将影响从那时开始绘制所有内容的方式。"
