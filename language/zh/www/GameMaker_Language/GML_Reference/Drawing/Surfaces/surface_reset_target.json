    "The above code will check to see which view is currently being drawn, and if it is view[0] it sets the draw target to a surface and draws all instances of the object \"obj_Effect\" before resetting the draw target again.

    "With this function you reset all further drawing from the target surface back to the screen. Please note that to start drawing to a surface you must first have called the function {}{}surface_set_target(){}{} and then this one after you have finished, {}for each surface target that you have set{} or else nothing will be drawn on the screen as all further drawing (even in other instances) will be done on the surface.
