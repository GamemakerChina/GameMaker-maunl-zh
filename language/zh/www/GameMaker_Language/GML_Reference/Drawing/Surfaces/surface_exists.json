If it does exist, it then checks to see which view is currently being drawn and if it is view[1] it draws the surface.":"上面的代码将检查在变量\"surf\"中索引的表面是否存在，如果不存在，它将重新创建它。如果确实存在，则检查查看当前正在绘制的视图，如果是视图[ 1]，则绘制表面。",

    "This function is essential when working with surfaces due to their volatile nature. Surfaces are always held in texture memory which means that they can be destroyed from one moment to the next (for example, when a screensaver starts on windows, or when minimised on an Android device), so you should always check that a surface exists before doing anything with it (this includes drawing it to the screen). The example code below shows a typical use of this command in the draw event of an instance to check for a surface and re-create it if it has been removed (note that the surface will have been originally created in the create event of the object).":"由于表面的挥发性，在处理表面时，此函数是必不可少的。表面总是保存在纹理内存中，这意味着它们可以从一个时刻到下一个时刻被销毁(例如，当屏幕保护程序在Windows上启动时，或者当在Android设备上最小化时)，因此在对表面进行任何操作之前，您应该始终检查表面是否存在(这包括将其绘制到屏幕上)。下面的示例代码显示了此命令在实例的\"绘制\"事件中的典型用法，用于检查表面并在其已被删除的情况下重新创建它(请注意，该表面最初是在对象的\"创建\"事件中创建的)。"
