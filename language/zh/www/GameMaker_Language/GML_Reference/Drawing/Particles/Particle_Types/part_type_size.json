    "Finally, you can set the \"wiggle\" factor. This is a value that will be added or subtracted randomly to the size each step of the particles lifetime. Obviously larger values are more pronounced than smaller ones, and this value can even be a negative with the maximum range being between -20 and 20.":"最后，您可以设置\"摆动\"因子。这是一个值，将随机添加或减去到粒子寿命的每个步骤的大小中。显然，较大的值比较小的值更明显，此值甚至可以是负值，最大范围在-20和20之间。",
    "How much should randomly be added or subtracted from the particles size per step.":"每个步骤的粒子大小应随机添加或减少多少。",
    "How much the particle should increase or decrease per step.":"粒子每步应增加或减少的程度。",
    "The above code will set various particle values including the size which is set to double the size when each particle is created, and then increment the size by 0.01 each step with a wiggle of 0.1 too.":"上述代码将设置各种粒子值，包括创建每个粒子时设置为两倍大小的大小，然后通过每个步骤将大小增加0.01，同时使用0.1的摆动。",
    "The index of the particle type to change.":"要更改的粒子类型的索引。",

    "This function is used to determine the size of the particle when it is created and can also be used to make the particle increase or decrease in size over its lifetime. The minimum and maximum size values default at 1 (meaning that the size is the same ratio as the base particle after the {}{}part_type_scale(){}{} scale has been set) and if they are set to the same value, the initial size for all particles will be the same, but if set to different values, each particle will start with a random size from within the range, for example if you have a minimum of 0.5 and a maximum of 2, all particles will be created with a size between half and double the base scale.":"该函数用于确定粒子在创建时的大小，也可用于使粒子在其寿命期间增加或减少大小。最小和最大大小值默认为1(意味着设置{}{}part_type_scale(){}{}比例后，大小与基础粒子的比例相同)，如果它们设置为相同的值，则所有粒子的初始大小将相同，但如果设置为不同的值，则每个粒子将从范围内的随机大小开始，例如，如果最小值为0.5且最大值为2，则将创建大小介于基础比例的一半和两倍之间的所有粒子。",
    "You can also set an increment value that will make the particle sprite grow (if a positive number) or shrink (if a negative number) over the lifetime of the particle, with the given amount being added to the particle size each step. This value can be a minimum of (+/-)0.01.":"还可以设置一个增量值，该值将使粒子精灵在粒子的生命周期内生长(如果为正数)或收缩(如果为负数)，并且每个步骤都将给定的量添加到粒子大小。此值最小可为(+/-) 0.01。"
