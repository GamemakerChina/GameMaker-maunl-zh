    "With this function you can write a string to a previously opened text file. If the file already contains information, this information will be erased and the string will be written at the beginning of the file, unless you have opened the file with the {}{}file_text_open_append(){}{}. You can also avoid this by using the {}{}file_text_readln(){}{} function along with the {}{}file_text_eof(){}{} function to loop through the contents of the file until you get to the end and then start writing.":"通过这个函数，您可以将字符串写入先前打开的文本文件。如果文件已经包含信息，则该信息将被擦除，字符串将写入文件的开头，除非您已经使用{}{}file_text_open_append(){}{}打开了文件。还可以通过使用{}{}file_text_readln(){}{}函数和{}{}file_text_eof(){}{}函数来循环遍历文件的内容，直到到达末尾，然后开始写入，从而避免这种情况。"
