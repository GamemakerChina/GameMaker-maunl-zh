    "With this function you can check two dates and times to see which one is the earlier or later than the other. The function returns -1 if {}date1{} is earlier, 1 if {}date1{} is later and 0 if they are the same, although since this takes time into account as well, a 0 for matching is very rare (it literally has to be the same second of the same day of the same month of the same year to return a 0).":"有了这个函数，你可以检查两个日期和时间，看看哪一个比另一个早或晚。如果{}date1{}较早，则函数返回-1，如果{}date1{}较晚，则返回0，如果相同，则返回0，不过由于这也考虑了时间，所以匹配的0非常罕见(实际上必须是同一年同月同日的同一秒才能返回0)。"
