    "This function returns the median of the input values, that is, the middle value. When the number of arguments is even, the smaller of the two middle values is returned and the function can have as many arguments as required (note that more arguments will mean that the function will be slower to parse) which must all be real values. This means that, for example, {}median(43, 12, 25, 19, 6){} would return 19 as it is the middle value between all the rest.":"这个函数返回输入值的中值，也就是中间值。当参数数量为偶数时，返回两个中间值中较小的那个，函数可以根据需要拥有任意数量的参数(注意，参数越多，函数解析的速度就越慢)，这些参数必须都是实数。这意味着，例如，{}median(43, 12, 25, 19, 6){}将返回19，因为它是所有其他值之间的中间值。",
    "This will stop the player from exiting any side of the room, by using median as a clamp. If the player, for instance, moves to the left of the room boundary, its x will be smaller than 0. This will mean the middle number of the first of the medians will be 0, so the player will be jumped to (0,y).":"这将阻止玩家离开房间的任何一侧，使用中间作为夹子。例如，如果玩家移动到房间边界的左边，它的x将小于0。这意味着第一个中位数的中间数将是0，所以玩家将跳转到(0,y)。"
