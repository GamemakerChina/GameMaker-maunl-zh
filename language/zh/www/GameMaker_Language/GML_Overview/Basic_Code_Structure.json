    "Code is written in&nbsp;{}blocks{}&nbsp;and a typical&nbsp;code block consists of a set of instructions, called {}statement{}{}s{}, that are then interpreted by {}GameMaker{} and used to make something happen within your game. That \"something\" can be as simple as adding 2 and 2 to get 4, or as complex as making an enemy run away when their health gets below a certain value. The actual structure of the program can vary greatly, depending on the functions it uses, but broken down to basics it just looks like this:":"代码以{}块{}形式写入，典型的代码块由一组名为{}语句{}{} {}的指令组成，然后由{}GameMaker{}解释并用于在游戏中实现某些操作。\"某事\"可以简单到加2和2得到4，或者复杂到让敌人在他们的健康状况低于一定值时逃跑。程序的实际结构可能会有很大差异，具体取决于它使用的功能，但细分到基本功能时，它只是看起来如下所示："
