    "{}GameMaker{} is more than just an IDE and has a number of different runtime tools that it uses behind the scenes to build you games for the different target platforms available. These tools are mainly the different runners and compilers that each\n    platform requires, and you can actually have several of each at any one time. What this means is that you can \"pick and choose\" which compiler version and which runner version to use should you have found any issues with the current one\n    or are aiming at a very specific target version or platform. Tools will automatically update when there is a new version available, but you can then use the {}Runtime Feeds Preferences{} to select which ones you actually want to use.\n    For more information on runtime updates please see {}Preferences - Runtime Feeds{}.":"{}GameMaker{}不仅仅是一个IDE，它还有许多不同的运行时工具，它可以在幕后为不同的目标平台制作游戏。这些工具主要是每个平台需要的不同的运行器和编译器，实际上您可以同时拥有多个。这意味着，如果您发现当前的编译器版本有任何问题，或者正在瞄准一个非常特定的目标版本或平台，那么您可以“选择”使用哪个编译器版本和哪个运行器版本。当有新版本可用时，工具将自动更新，但是您可以使用{}运行时 首选项{}来选择您实际想使用的版本。有关运行时更新的更多信息，请参见{}首选项-运行时{}。"
