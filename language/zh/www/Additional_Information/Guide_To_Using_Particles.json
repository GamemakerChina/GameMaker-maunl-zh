    "Before setting up a system and creating particles, it\u0027s important to know a few things... First is that most of a particle systems code is {}only ever called once in the game{}, usually in some type of controller object in the first room or level - this is not always the case, but for the sake of simplicity, we\u0027ll be using this scenario for the following brief guide as it\u0027s the most common way to use particles. You do this because a particle system, once created, stays in memory and is ready to be used at any time, so if you create it more than once it can quickly increase the memory usage and cause serious lag, and even has the potential of crashing the game. For the sake of simplicity in this guide, you&nbsp;will make a {}global {}particle system that can be used by any instance in the game at any time.":"Before setting up a system and creating particles, it\u0027s important to know a few things...
