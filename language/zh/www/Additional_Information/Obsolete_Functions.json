    "As with backgrounds (explained above) the {}tile {}resource from legacy GameMaker&nbsp;no longer exists, and instead we have {}Tile Sets{} in {}GameMaker{}. In legacy GameMaker, tiles used a background resource and were placed at different depths in the room editor or through code, however the method used was not terribly flexible and was also not that efficient. To address these issues, in {}GameMaker{} tilesets are now created from a sprite resource, and can have various different properties (like animation or auto-tiling). They are then placed on a tilemap layer within the room editor or through code. Due to these changes the following functions are now obsolete:":"与背景(如上所述)一样，来自传统GameMaker的{}磁贴{}资源不再存在，取而代之的是{}GameMaker{}中的{}磁贴集{}。在传统GameMaker中，磁贴使用背景资源，并通过房间编辑器或代码放置在不同的深度，但是使用的方法并不非常灵活，效率也不高。为了解决这些问题，在{}GameMaker{}中，现在从精灵资源创建了图集，并且可以具有各种不同的属性(如动画或自动平铺)。然后将它们放置在房间编辑器或通过代码内的tilemap图层上。由于这些变化，以下功能现已过时：",
    "Both legacy GameMaker and {}GameMaker{} have a visual scripting {}GML Visual{}&nbsp;interface for creating your games, however the way it is handled in {}GameMaker{} is quite different to the previous methods used. Previously, all GML Visual actions had their own corresponding function which worked \"behind the scenes\" to get the desired results, however this was not very transparent and added in extra overheads to the function calls, resulting in poorer performance. In {}GameMaker{} this has been changed, and now all actions compile to pure code (and can be shown as such if required), meaning that the following action functions are obsolete:":"旧版本GameMaker和{}GameMaker{}都有一个可视化脚本{}GML Visual{}界面来创建您的游戏，但是{}GameMaker{}中处理它的方式与以前使用的方法大不相同。以前，所有GML Visual操作都有自己相应的函数，这些函数\"在幕后\"工作以获得所需的结果，但是这不是很透明，并且在函数调用中增加了额外的开销，导致性能较差。在{}GameMaker{}中，这已更改，现在所有操作都编译为纯代码(如果需要，可以显示为纯代码)，这意味着以下操作函数已过时：",
    "Here you can find a list of all the functions that have been made obsolete when you compare {}GameMaker{} to legacy versions of the product. The functions listed here will be converted into {}compatibility scripts{} when you import a {}*.yyz{} made with a legacy version, and you can continue to work on the project as before. However, we recommend that you revise all the compatibility scripts created in a project, and ensure that future projects use the new functions/methods of working rather than depend on these scripts.":"在这里，您可以找到将{}GameMaker{}与产品的旧版本进行比较已过时的所有功能的列表。当您导入使用旧版制作的{}*. yyz{}时，此处列出的函数将转换为{}兼容性脚本{}，您可以像以前一样继续处理该项目。但是，我们建议您修改项目中创建的所有兼容性脚本，并确保未来的项目使用新的功能/工作方法，而不是依赖这些脚本。",
    "In legacy GameMaker you had a separate {}background {}resource, where you could add images to be used as backgrounds. In {}GameMaker{} all images are considered sprites, and the use you put them too will depend on the layer they are assigned to in the room. This means that there is no longer a \"background\" resource, and it also means that the following functions are obsolete:":"在旧版GameMaker中，您有一个单独的{}背景{}资源，您可以在其中添加用作背景的图像。在{}GameMaker{}中，所有图像都被认为是精灵，你把它们放在房间里的用途也取决于它们被分配到的图层。这意味着不再有\"背景\"资源，也意味着以下功能已过时：",

    "The way objects are treated in {}GameMaker{} has changed slightly due to the introduction of layers in the room editor.

This makes the following functions obsolete:":"由于在房间编辑器中引入了图层，{}GameMaker{}中处理对象的方式略有变化。仍然存在\"深度\"变量，但它现在仅用于兼容性，您不再可以获取或设置对象的深度，只能获取实例。这使得以下功能过时：",
    "When using 3D models or primitives in legacy GameMaker, you had to use the {}d3d_{} functions.

    "With the advent of the camera functions in {}GameMaker{}, it means that a number of view variables are no longer required, specifically those referring to the view into the room rather than the view_port (which is still used).
