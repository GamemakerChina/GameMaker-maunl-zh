    "Now, before we go on to explain each of these things in more detail, we\u0027ll quickly outline how {}GameMaker{} will turn the above building blocks into your game. Basically, everything happens in what is called the {}Game Loop{}, which has a speed measured in {} Frames Per Second{}, and one \"frame\" is called a {}Step {}in GameMaker. The default frames per second (or {}FPS{}) is 60, meaning that for every second that passes {}GameMaker{} will run the game loop 60 times, and each step (loop/frame) a number of events will occur and the game will progress.":"现在，在我们继续更详细地解释这些事情之前，我们将快速概述{}GameMaker{}将如何将上述构建块转化为您的游戏。基本上，所有事情都发生在称为{}游戏循环{}中，其速度以{}帧/秒{}为单位测量，\"一帧\"在GameMaker中称为{}步骤{}。默认的每秒帧数(或{}Fps{})为60，这意味着{}GameMaker{}每经过一秒钟就会运行游戏循环60次，并且每个步骤(循环/帧)都会发生多个事件，游戏将继续进行。",

    "To help understand this, let\u0027s imagine you have a character that you want to move around the game room. You would create a {}sprite {}for that character, then create an {}object {}and assign it the sprite, and in the object you\u0027d add an {}event {}called the {}Step Event{}. In this event you would tell it to move right by 2 pixels. You would then place an {}instance {}of that object into the game room, and when you run the game, the instance will start moving right by 2 pixels every step (the Step Event runs once every game step), so that in 1 second&nbsp;the instance has moved 120 pixels to the right.":"为了帮助理解这一点，让我们假设您有一个角色要在游戏室中移动。您将为该角色创建一个{}精灵{}，然后创建一个{}对象{}并为其指定精灵，并在对象中添加一个名为{}步骤事件{}的{}事件{}。在这种情况下，您将告诉它向右移动2个像素。然后将该对象的{}实例{}放入游戏室，当您运行游戏时，该实例将开始每步向右移动2个像素(Step Event每个游戏步运行一次)，因此在1秒钟内，该实例已向右移动120个像素。",
    "To illustrate the {}GameMaker{} workflow and get you straight into making something, we\u0027ve prepared the this guide to take&nbsp;you from the very basics of what is {}GameMaker{} and what is a program, through creating general assets and up to how to code&nbsp;basic things like movement and score.":"为了说明{}GameMaker{}的工作流程并让你直接开始做点什么，我们准备了这份指南，让你从什么是{}GameMaker{}和什么是程序的基本知识，到创建一般资源，再到如何编写动作和分数等基本内容。",
